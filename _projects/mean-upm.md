The main goal of this project is to develop an addon for the Mozilla Firefox browser and for Google Chrome in order to be able to calculate the average of the transcript of records at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.

The idea of making this extension came because the university does not provide any tool to calculate the mean average. So, I developed an addon for personal use to avoid the use of Excel that would allow me to calculate it. Moreover, it not only calculates the average for each year and for each course, but it also calculates statistics and shows them to the user so he can see the evolution along his studies, as well as see the distribution of the grades for the different exams.

Once developed, I decided to publish the addon in the [Web Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calculadora-nota-media-up/aaddcgfkamakcndombcojcaehjoanpkj) so that any student could use it for personal use.
