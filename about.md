Hey! I'm Tasio Mendez, a **Telecom Engineer** specialized in **Big Data and Cloud Computing**.
I started my studies at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid where I studied the Bachelor of Engineering in Telecommunication Technologies and Services.

Later I started my master studies in Madrid and finished them in Milan where I specialized in computer science, more specifically in Big Data and Cloud Computing.

I have some experience working in European research projects related to Agent-based Social Simulation, Machine Learning and Emotion Analysis,
as well as presenting results at international conferences.

Currently, I am finishing my Master's studies at the **Politecnico di Milano**, focusing my Master's Thesis on DevOps techniques using tools such as Terraform and Cloudify.
Upon completion of my studies, I have expectations of working abroad in fields related to my studies:
big data, cloud computing, devops, machine learning and artificial intelligence...

If you are interested in cooperation or would like to discuss anything, don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
